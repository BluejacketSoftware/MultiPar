# MultiPar

v1.3.0.6 is public

 This is a minor update version. 
I fixed a small bug, which might leave some temporary files (such like, something_par.tmp) at failed reapir. 
When repair was successful, there is no problem.

 I updated Italian language UI DLL. Thanks Botta for translation help. 
If someone sees a miskate of translation in your language, please notice me. 
I will correct at later version.
