# MultiPar

v1.3.0.7 is public

 I updated some documents and Help files in this version. 
There is no difference in EXE files' process. 
I erased a URL of MultiPar forum, because the hosting Live Business Chat disappered. 
Thanks Mr. Badon to maintain the web-forum for long time. 
I will public sample version and source code on my OneDrive and GitHub page.

 I set this version as the final release of v1.3.0 tree. 
As I upgraded my PC (it becomes very fast with Core i5 !), 
I may change my developing environment to Visual Studio 2010 in future. 
So, this would be the last version which supports Windows XP. 
If many users still use old PCs with Windows XP and want MultiPar to support the obsolete OS, 
I keep Visual Studio 2008 for them.
